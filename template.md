## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the high-level design for the networking infrastructure of [briefly describe the system/application].  It serves as a blueprint for the implementation and provides a common understanding of the network architecture. Edit.

### 1.2 Scope

This HLD covers the network architecture, key components, connectivity, security considerations, and performance requirements.  It does *not* include detailed configuration specifics, which will be addressed in the Low-Level Design (LLD) document.

### 1.3 Audience

This document is intended for network engineers, system administrators, security personnel, and other stakeholders involved in the design, implementation, and maintenance of the network.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Goals and Objectives

* [List the key business goals that the network design supports.  E.g., High availability, scalability, security, performance]
* [Specific objectives related to the network. E.g., Support for X users, bandwidth requirements, latency targets]

### 2.2 Constraints

* [Any limitations or constraints that impact the design. E.g., Budget, existing infrastructure, regulatory requirements]

## 3. Network Architecture
